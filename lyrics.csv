"Beyonce","Bday",2006,"Encore For The Fans","I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, Dreamgirls. Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is Listen"

"Katy Perry","Smile",2020,"Message From Katy","Hello to everybody listening to Smile, it's Katy Perry I wanna say a very special hello to all of my incredible, beautiful, loyal, encouraging KatyCats all around the world Thank you so much for being on this journey with me every single time I put out a record, and for being excited and letting the music, um... work its magic on you, and for showing up at the shows, and all the little places, and for being such an incredible team and a support system that I can always rely on I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you, and the things that you make online, that make me laugh, and the care that you show, and... all of it, I am so profoundly grateful And that's what a lot of this record is: it's, it's a... a record that I never really set out to make, but here we are. You know, after continuing my writing process for 2 years, I would get a little message and just be a vessel for, um... different songs or ideas over the past 2 years, and we had many of them so we felt like, maybe it should be a record. Maybe the record should be called Smile, and it should be about finding your smile once again Um... I don't know about any of you, but sometimes I can feel super low, and alone, and really in my head, and be my own worst enemy, and let that horrible negative voice that trickle, trickles in and out of my, of my head, take over. And, in this past couple of years I've really, um, tried to work on that; and I think a lot of these songs reflect walking through that process, walking through that valley, and coming out the other end alive, and giving live, and, um... So, I just, I'm so grateful you guys are listening, I, um... I'm excited, I wanna know what your favorite songs are. I have one more song that you're about to hear, um, this song is kind of a funny, sassy song. Definitely don't @ me when you hear it, but thank you once again for listening to all the songs. I hope these songs are encouraging and can lift you out of whatever you're feeling, or give you a little umpfh, or, um... give you whatever you need for today. And if you lost your smile, it helps you find your smile again God bless you! I love you"

"Pink","Im Not Dead",2006,"I Have Seen The Rain","This next song is called I Have Seen The Rain and it was written by my daddy, Mr. Jim Moore. He wrote it back in Vietnam about 40 years ago, and I grew up singing it with him at different Vietnam Vet functions. It's how I learned to harmonize and how to love an acoustic guitar, and the way that we recorded it; it was my Dad's first time in a recording studio, and he always said, Singers don't really have to work too hard - and he changed his mind that day. But we did it live, him and I in the vocal booth together, him playing and singing and me harmonizing. One take, straight through. It was a really, really good time, it was really special to be able to record a song with my Dad, the first song I ever learned. We hope you like it and we dedicate it to all the Vets out there I have seen the rain I have felt the pain I don't know where I'll be tomorrow I don't know where I'm going I don't even know where I've been But I know, I'd like to see them again Spend my days just searching Spend my nights in dreams Stop looking over my shoulder, baby I've stopped wondering what it means Drop out, burn out, soldier home Oh, they've said I should've been more Probably so if I hadn't had been in that crazy damn Vietnam war I have seen the rain I've survived the pain Oh, I've been home 30 years or so And I'm just stepping off of the plane Spend my days just searching Spend my nights in dreams Stop looking over my shoulder, baby I've stopped wondering what it means Drop out, burn out, soldier home Oh, they've said I should've been more Probably so if I hadn't had been in that crazy damn Vietnam war We have seen the rain, together We've survived the pain, forever Oh, it's good to be home again It's good to be with my friends Oh, it's good to be home again It's good to feel that rain"
